    "# Sales Helper - AI-Powered Company Research Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an intelligent sales research assistant that automates the process of gathering comprehensive information about potential clients or partners. The system uses a multi-agent approach to extract company information, identify industry classifications, gather relevant news, and discover applicable AWS solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Automated Web Scraping**: Extracts company information directly from websites\n",
    "- **Industry Classification**: Automatically categorizes companies into predefined industry sectors\n",
    "- **News Intelligence**: Finds relevant industry news and trends\n",
    "- **AWS Solutions Matching**: Discovers applicable AWS solutions for the company's industry\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Uses LangGraph to orchestrate multiple specialized agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Multi-Agent Design\n",
    "The system uses a **parallel processing approach** where:\n",
    "1. **Bio Agent** runs first to establish company context\n",
    "2. **News** and **Solutions** agents run in parallel using the bio context\n",
    "3. **Summary Agent** combines all information (future enhancement)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technology Stack\n",
    "- **LangGraph**: Orchestrates the multi-agent workflow\n",
    "- **AWS Bedrock**: Powers the LLM reasoning (Claude models)\n",
    "- **Playwright**: Handles robust web scraping\n",
    "- **DuckDuckGo**: Provides news search capabilities\n",
    "- **AWS MCP**: Accesses official AWS documentation and solutions"
